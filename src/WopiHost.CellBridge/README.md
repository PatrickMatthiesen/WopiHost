# WopiHost.CellBridge

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental.** This package wires the open-source [cellbridge](https://github.com/PatrickMatthiesen/cellbridge) MS-FSSHTTP engine into WopiHost as an alternative to the proprietary [`WopiHost.Cobalt`](../WopiHost.Cobalt/README.md). It compiles and its unit tests drive real MS-FSSHTTPB requests through the WOPI seam, but it has **not** been exercised against Office Online Server — see [What is still unknown](#what-is-still-unknown). `WopiHost.Cobalt` remains the production path.

[cellbridge](https://github.com/PatrickMatthiesen/cellbridge) (MIT, .NET 10, by [Patrick Matthiesen](https://github.com/PatrickMatthiesen)) implements [MS-FSSHTTP](https://learn.microsoft.com/openspecs/sharepoint_protocols/ms-fsshttp/) (the SOAP/MTOM cell-storage envelope), [MS-FSSHTTPB](https://learn.microsoft.com/openspecs/sharepoint_protocols/ms-fsshttpb/) (the binary storage index / data-element / knowledge graph) and the chunking that shreds Office packages into reusable parts — the whole stack that `Microsoft.CobaltCore.dll` provides to `WopiHost.Cobalt`. It was written so desktop Word/Excel/PowerPoint can open, edit and save documents against a plain ASP.NET Core server the way they do against SharePoint; this package reuses its protocol engine behind WopiHost's existing `ICobaltProcessor` seam.

## How it fits

```
Office Online Server ──X-WOPI-Override: COBALT──▶ WopiHost.Core (POST /wopi/files/{id})
                                                       │  ICobaltProcessor.ProcessCobalt(file, principal, body)
                                                       ├── WopiHost.Cobalt     → Microsoft.CobaltCore (proprietary)
                                                       └── WopiHost.CellBridge → CellBridge.AspNetCore + FssHttpB + Storage (MIT)
```

* `ICobaltProcessor` (in `WopiHost.Abstractions`) is the only contract the WOPI endpoint depends on, so the two backends are drop-in alternatives and exactly one is registered per host.
* `CellBridgeProcessor` imports each WOPI file into cellbridge's document store on first use (`CellBridgeDocumentService.ImportAsync`), executes the request through `CellBridgeDocumentService.ExecuteAsync` / `FssHttpLockCoordinator`, and when a save advances cellbridge's content version it copies the materialized Office package back out through `IWopiWritableFile.OpenWriteAsync()` so `GetFile` and non-Cobalt clients see the result. This mirrors what `CobaltProcessor` does with `CobaltFile` + `GenericFda`.
* State lives in cellbridge's **in-memory** stores (`InMemoryStateStore` / `InMemoryContentStore`), the same single-process posture as `WopiHost.Cobalt`'s `LocalHostBlobStore`. cellbridge also ships PostgreSQL and filesystem stores for multi-instance deployments; swapping them in is a constructor change.
* Authorization stays with WOPI: the `COBALT` endpoint already requires the token's update permission, so `WopiCellBridgeAccessEvaluator` grants read/write inside cellbridge unconditionally instead of duplicating grants there.

## Enable it

This adapter uses `CellBridge.AspNetCore` and `CellBridge.Storage.InMemory` version `0.1.0-beta.2` from NuGet.org. The versions are managed in `Directory.Packages.props`.

Enable the optional backend explicitly. Building the adapter and running its tests does not require a CellBridge checkout or the private Cobalt feed:

```sh
dotnet build src/WopiHost.CellBridge/WopiHost.CellBridge.csproj -p:IncludeCellBridge=true -p:IncludeCobalt=false
dotnet test --project test/WopiHost.CellBridge.Tests/WopiHost.CellBridge.Tests.csproj -p:IncludeCellBridge=true -p:IncludeCobalt=false
```

`IncludeCellBridge` still auto-detects a sibling CellBridge checkout for compatibility with the existing AppHost demo. Without a checkout, pass `-p:IncludeCellBridge=true`; otherwise the adapter and its tests compile as no-ops. `CellBridgeRepoRoot` is only needed for the source-based demo described below.

Then in the sample host:

```jsonc
{
  "Sample": { "CoauthoringProvider": "CellBridge" },   // None | CobaltCore | CellBridge
  "Wopi": {
    "CellBridge": {
      "SerializationProfile": "SharePoint13_11",       // or "Current" (MS-FSSHTTPB v12 framing)
      "WebOrigin": ""                                  // WebUrl attribute on SOAP responses, if that framing is in use
    }
  }
}
```

or in your own host:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddCellBridgeProcessor(builder.Configuration);
```

When `ICobaltProcessor` is registered, `WopiHost.Core` advertises `SupportsCobalt` / `SupportsCoauth` in `CheckFileInfo` and routes `X-WOPI-Override: COBALT` bodies to it.

`.github/workflows/cellbridge-integration.yml` still checks out a pinned CellBridge commit for the source-based AppHost demo. The adapter itself now uses the package versions in `Directory.Packages.props`.

## Try cellbridge itself

cellbridge's own demo (desktop Office editing against its document library) runs from the WopiHost AppHost with `AppHost:UseCellBridge=true` (built with `IncludeCellBridge`): a PostgreSQL container, schema init, a seeded `integration-writer` account (`AppHost:CellBridgeTestPassword`) and the library at `https://localhost:7292/library`. Windows desktop Office must trust the ASP.NET Core dev certificate; see [cellbridge's demo guide](https://github.com/PatrickMatthiesen/cellbridge/blob/main/docs/demo-library.md). This lane demonstrates cellbridge, not WopiHost + cellbridge: nothing Docker-distributable speaks Cobalt over WOPI.

## What is still unknown

1. **The WOPI `COBALT` body framing.** `ICobaltProcessor` receives bytes without a Content-Type. cellbridge parses SOAP (what desktop Office posts to `cellstorage.svc`) and raw MS-FSSHTTPB cell requests; `Microsoft.CobaltCore` reads its own `RequestBatch` wire format, which carries lock/co-auth/editors subrequests *and* cell requests in one binary batch. `WopiCobaltFraming` sniffs for the two framings cellbridge understands and the processor throws `NotSupportedException` (logging the first bytes) for anything else. **The first milestone is capturing a real OOS `COBALT` request** — set the sample's logging to `Debug` and hit the endpoint from an OOS/OWA 2013 session — and teaching cellbridge (or this adapter) that framing. This was also the first step the [#321](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/issues/321) analysis called for.
2. **MTOM over WOPI.** If OOS posts `multipart/related`, the boundary lives in the Content-Type header the current `ICobaltProcessor` signature drops; the contract would need to carry it.
3. **Adopting the shared request processor.** CellBridge beta.2 provides `CellBridgeRequestProcessor` for parsed MS-FSSHTTP requests without an HTTP endpoint. This adapter still dispatches subrequests itself and returns `NotSupported` for `EditorsTable`, `GetDocMetaInfo` and `GetVersions`; it needs to adopt the shared processor.
4. **Cleanup.** This adapter retains imported documents for the process lifetime. Beta.2 provides lifecycle deletion through `IDocumentLifecycleStore.TryDeleteAsync`, but deletion retires resource IDs and is distinct from temporary idle-session eviction. The adapter still needs a cleanup policy.
5. **Two-desktop co-authoring** is unverified in cellbridge itself (single-desktop Word/Excel/PowerPoint save + reopen is).

## How the two sets of abstractions line up

Side by side, with what the first integration showed about each seam:

| Concern | WopiHost | cellbridge | Fit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Published document bytes | `IWopiWritableFile.OpenReadAsync` / `OpenWriteAsync` — one mutable stream per file, committed on dispose | `IContentStore` — immutable, content-addressed blobs (`WriteAsync(stream) → ContentHandle{Sha256}`), used for the materialized package **and** every graph element payload | Half. The materialized package maps cleanly (this adapter mirrors it on publish). Graph payloads are protocol state WopiHost has no slot for and should not grow one — `WopiHost.Cobalt` keeps CobaltCore's `HostBlobStore` private for the same reason. |
| Protocol state (storage index, knowledge, editors, leases, receipts) | none — `WopiHost.Cobalt` keeps `CobaltFile` sessions and the editors table in process memory | `IDocumentStateStore.TransitionAsync(id, (current, now) => …)` — atomic publish of an immutable `DocumentState` under per-document coordination with authoritative time | No counterpart, and cellbridge's model is the stronger one: a durable, multi-instance co-authoring state store is something WopiHost gains by adopting it rather than wrapping it. |
| Locks | `IWopiLockProvider` — one lock id per file, 30-minute expiry, CAS (`TryUnlockAndRelockAsync`, `RefreshLockAsync(expected)`) | `CoordinationState` — a schema lock shared by co-authors, an exclusive lease, coauthor transitions | Overlapping but disjoint today: WOPI `PutFile` honours `IWopiLockProvider` while FSSHTTP saves honour the lease — true with CobaltCore as well (`CobaltHostLockingStore` answers every lock request with an empty success). A cellbridge exclusive lease that consults `IWopiLockProvider` would be the first time both save paths share one lock domain. The most valuable unification target. |
| Document identity | opaque string ids (`IWopiResource.Identifier`, SHA-256 of a canonical path) | `ResourceId` GUID plus URL `PathKey`; beta.2 also accepts a host-supplied GUID | This adapter keeps a map. A host-supplied or deterministically derived `ResourceId` removes it and survives restarts with a durable state store. |
| Caller identity | `ClaimsPrincipal` from the WOPI access token (`NameIdentifier`, `Name`) | `CellBridgeActor.FromPrincipal` over `cellbridge:subject` / `cellbridge:display-name` claims | Clean. `ActorFor` maps `NameIdentifier` to `wopi:<id>`. |
| Permissions | capability-style: `wopi:fperms` baked into the token at mint time, read through `IWopiPermissionProvider.GetFilePermissionsAsync(principal, file)` (async) | ACL-style: `DocumentSecurity` grants stored on the document, evaluated by `ICellBridgeAccessEvaluator.Evaluate(actor, state)` (sync, inside transactions) | Different philosophies, one seam. The token is WOPI's source of truth, so the evaluator defers to it; today it grants read/write unconditionally because the `COBALT` endpoint already requires the token's update permission. Beta.2 can carry a request permission ceiling through `CellBridgeActor.AccessLimit`; this adapter has not adopted it. |
| Sign-in | WOPI access token + proof keys; Office Online Server never sees a login page | MS-OFBA forms sign-in for desktop Office (`CellBridge.Authentication`) | Not applicable over WOPI; stays out. |

Beta.2 provides the following APIs. Integrating them into this adapter remains separate work:

1. Use `CellBridgeRequestProcessor` to execute parsed SOAP requests without CellBridge's routes or sign-in.
2. Use `CellBridgeDocumentService.CreateAsync` with a host-supplied resource GUID instead of the in-process identity map.
3. Carry WOPI's per-request permission ceiling through `CellBridgeActor.AccessLimit`, and map host-owned authorization through `ICellBridgeAuthorizationPolicy` where needed.
4. Adopt `ExternalRevisionPublisher` and `IExternalRevisionDestination` for revision delivery. The destination must support version checks and durable receipts; WOPI's unconditional write stream alone does not satisfy that contract.
5. Use lifecycle deletion for retired documents and design idle-session cleanup separately.


What the exercise said about WopiHost's own contracts: `ICobaltProcessor` is the right seam (no `WopiHost.Core` change was needed) but drops the request Content-Type, which an MTOM body would need; `IWopiWritableFile.OpenWriteAsync` has no version precondition, so a host cannot ask for "write only if still at version N" the way cellbridge's publish does; and `IWopiPermissionProvider` is async and principal-based where cellbridge needs a synchronous answer inside a transaction, so an adapter has to resolve permissions up front and hand the result in.

## Distribution

The adapter consumes CellBridge in-process through NuGet package references. Update the two versions in `Directory.Packages.props` together when trying a new CellBridge release. The optional standalone desktop demo still needs the CellBridge source checkout; it is separate from the WOPI adapter.
